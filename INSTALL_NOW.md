## 🎯 OPTION 1: Fully Automated Installation (Recommended)

### **Prerequisites:**
You need **Composer** installed first (one-time setup)

### **Step 1: Install Composer** (5 minutes)
1. Click here to download: [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)
2. Run the installer
3. When asked for PHP location, select: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`
4. Complete the installation
5. **Restart your computer** (important!)

### **Step 2: Run Automated Installation** (1 click!)
1. Go to: `c:\xampp1\htdocs\new 360 Project`
2. **Double-click:** `install.bat`
3. The script will automatically:
   - ✅ Install Laravel framework
   - ✅ Configure environment
   - ✅ Create database
   - ✅ Run migrations
   - ✅ Seed test data
   - ✅ Start the server
   - ✅ Open browser

**That's it! Everything will be done automatically!**

---

## 🎯 OPTION 2: Manual Installation (If Composer is already installed)

If you already have Composer, just run these commands:

```powershell
cd "c:\xampp1\htdocs\new 360 Project"
.\install.bat
```

The script handles everything automatically!

---

## 🎯 OPTION 3: Download Pre-configured Laravel (No Composer needed)

If you don't want to install Composer, I can provide you with a different approach:

### Download Laravel 11 Manually:
1. Visit: https://github.com/laravel/laravel/archive/refs/heads/11.x.zip
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy all files to: `c:\xampp1\htdocs\new 360 Project`
4. Then run: `install.bat`

---

## 📋 What the Install Script Does:

The `install.bat` script automatically:

1. ✅ **Checks** if Composer is installed
2. ✅ **Installs** Laravel 11 framework
3. ✅ **Creates** .env configuration file
4. ✅ **Generates** application key
5. ✅ **Configures** database for XAMPP
6. ✅ **Creates** database '360winestate'
7. ✅ **Runs** all migrations
8. ✅ **Seeds** test user accounts
9. ✅ **Optimizes** the application
10. ✅ **Starts** the development server
11. ✅ **Opens** browser to http://localhost:8000

**All with ONE click!**
