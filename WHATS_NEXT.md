## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Skip Composer Installation

If you don't want to install Composer, you can:

### Option 1: Use XAMPP's PHP Directly
```powershell
# In PowerShell, navigate to project folder
cd "c:\xampp1\htdocs\new 360 Project"

# Download Laravel manually
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/laravel/laravel/archive/refs/heads/11.x.zip" -OutFile "laravel.zip"

# Extract and setup
# (This is more complex - Composer is recommended)
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-built Laravel Package
I can provide you with a different setup method that doesn't require Composer, but it's more manual.

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDED PATH:

**Just install Composer!** It's a one-time setup and makes everything automatic.

### Quick Summary:
1. ✅ Download: https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe
2. ✅ Install (select `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`)
3. ✅ Restart computer
4. ✅ Run `install.bat`
5. ✅ Done!

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### "Can't find php.exe during Composer installation"
- Browse to: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`
- If not there, check: `C:\xampp7\php\php.exe` or `C:\xampp8\php\php.exe`

### "Composer installed but still not found"
- Restart your computer (required!)
- Open new terminal/command prompt
